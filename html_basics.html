 <!-- (HTML ELEMENT button) this creates a button--> 
<button>Hello</button> 

<!-- HTML element is used to describe anything that we can display on the webpage (has opening tag <p> and the end is a closing tag)-->

<!--(HTML ELEMENT p) stands for a paragraph text-->
<p> paragraph of text</p> <!--the inside of this is called the content-->

<!--anker element (link to another website)-->
<!-- SIDE NOTE: href and target only work on the link elements-->
<!--Target attribute determines where the link should be opened (giving a new tab) -->
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Link to YouTube</a> <!-- href=="" is an attribute, it modifies how the element behaves (meaning you can change destination)-->


<!--example what people get confused in when learning-->
<p> paragraph      of text</p> <!--extra space like these get ignore, you need to tell it what you want through code-->

<p> 
  paragraph text   <!-- same concept is applied to spacing-->
</p>

<!-- so do as many spaces to understand the code, it doesnt need to be a specific way, just make it readable-->
